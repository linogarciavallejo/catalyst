2. React Router setup for SPA
3. State management (Redux or Zustand)
4. Core pages: Home, Idea Detail, Create, Profile
5. Components: IdeaCard, IdeaForm, CommentThread, etc.
6. Integration with backend API
7. SignalR client setup for real-time updates
8. Frontend testing (Jest/React Testing Library)

### Phase 7: Frontend Testing
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for pages
- E2E tests for critical flows

### Phase 8: Polish & Integration Testing
- E2E testing across frontend + backend
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- User acceptance testing

### Phase 9: Deployment (When Ready)
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

The Catalyst project has made **excellent progress** on the backend implementation:

- ✅ **Backend**: 90% complete, production-ready, thoroughly tested
- ✅ **Architecture**: Clean, scalable, well-organized
- ✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive (264 tests), all passing
- ✅ **Real-time**: Full SignalR infrastructure implemented
- ⏳ **Frontend**: Ready to begin development

The backend is solid enough to support frontend development immediately. The API is ready, repositories are tested, and real-time communication is established.

**Recommended action**: Begin Phase 6 (Frontend Development) with the React app scaffold and initial pages.
