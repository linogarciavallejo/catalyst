## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Optimistic Update Flow

```
User Action
    ↓
[1] Update UI Immediately (optimistic state)
    ↓
[2] Show pending indicator
    ↓
[3] Send to Server
    ├─→ ✅ Success → Move to confirmed state → Hide indicator
    └─→ ❌ Error → Rollback → Show error message
```

### Connection Management

```
Browser Connected
    ↓
Check Connection Type (WebSocket vs REST)
    ↓
Maintain Connection State
    ├─→ Connected → Display normal UI
    ├─→ Offline → Show offline indicator + retry
    └─→ Reconnecting → Show spinner + attempt count
    
Auto-Reconnect with Exponential Backoff:
1st retry: 1 second
2nd retry: 2 seconds
3rd retry: 4 seconds
4th retry: 8 seconds
5th+ retry: 30 seconds (max)
```

### Real-Time Listener Infrastructure

```
Hook Setup
    ↓
Register Listener: hook.onEventType((data) => { /* handle */ })
    ↓
Server Broadcasts Event
    ↓
All Registered Listeners Notified
    ↓
Local State Updated
    ↓
UI Re-renders with New Data
```

## 🧪 Testing Coverage

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ Vote immediately shows, confirms with server
- ✅ Comment immediately shows, confirms with server
- ✅ Idea immediately shows, confirms with server
- ✅ Connection indicator shows/hides correctly
- ✅ Offline state triggers indicator
- ✅ Error rollback removes pending items
- ✅ Pending items sort correctly

## 🚀 What Users Experience

### Before (Waiting for Server)
1. User clicks "Upvote"
2. Button is disabled, shows spinner
3. Network request sent
4. User waits 200-500ms
5. Server responds
6. Vote count updates
7. Button re-enables

**User Experience**: Slow, frustrating, time wasted

### After (With Optimistic Updates)
1. User clicks "Upvote"
2. Vote count updates immediately
3. Vote shows as "pending"
4. Network request sent in background
5. Server confirms
6. Pending state removed
7. Vote confirmed

**User Experience**: Instant feedback, smooth, responsive
