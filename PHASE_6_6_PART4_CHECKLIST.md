## Implementation Details

### Optimistic Update Flow
```
User Action
  ↓
[1] Create optimistic state with temporary ID
  ↓
[2] Display in UI immediately
  ↓
[3] Send request to server
  ├─→ Success: Replace optimistic with real, notify listeners
  └─→ Error: Remove optimistic, show error message
```

### Connection Management
```
App Loads
  ↓
Check browser online status
  ↓
If offline: Show ConnectionIndicator
  ↓
Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
  ├─→ 1st: Wait 1s, retry
  ├─→ 2nd: Wait 2s, retry
  ├─→ 3rd: Wait 4s, retry
  ├─→ 4th: Wait 8s, retry
  └─→ 5th+: Wait 30s, retry
```

### Real-Time Listener Foundation
```
Hook registers listener
  ↓
Operation succeeds
  ↓
Notify all listeners
  ↓
Listeners update local state
  ↓
UI re-renders with fresh data
```
